Hi! I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple AI/ML working on question answering.
I graduated from the research-oriented master program MLT of [Language Technology Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) in [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu).
I was fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/) and Prof. [Bogdan Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), and collaborate with Prof. [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/).
Prior to that, I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Tsinghua University.
My undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. [Jie Tang](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/), was honored outstanding thesis.

My research interests generally include representation learning, natural language processing, and their applications to software engineering.
My current and past works span contrastive learning, graph representation learning, knowledge graphs, text generation, and question answering.
I am also interested in learning parallel computing and distributed systems.

**New:** I joined üçé Apple AI/ML as a Machine Learning Engineer in June 2022!
